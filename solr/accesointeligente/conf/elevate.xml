	The QueryElevationComponent enables you to configure the top results
	for a given query regardless of the normal lucene scoring. This is
	sometimes called "sponsored search", "editorial boosting" or "best bets".
	This component matches the user query text to a configured Map of top results.
	Although this component will work with any QueryParser, it makes the
	most sense to use with DisMax style queries.
